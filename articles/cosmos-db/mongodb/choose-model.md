# What is RU-based and vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB?

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL, relational, and vector database for modern app development.

Both, the Request Unit (RU) and vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB offering make it easy to use Azure Cosmos DB as if it were a MongoDB database. Both options work without the overhead of complex management and scaling approaches. You can use your existing MongoDB skills and continue to use your favorite MongoDB drivers, SDKs, and tools by pointing your application to the connection string for your account using the API for MongoDB. Additionally, both are cloud-native offerings that can be integrated seamlessly with other Azure services to build enterprise-grade modern applications.

## Choose between vCore-based and RU-based

Here are a few key factors to help you decide which is the right option for you.

### Choose vCore-based if

- You're migrating (lift & shift) an existing MongoDB workload or building a new MongoDB application.
- Your workload has more long-running queries, complex aggregation pipelines, distributed transactions, joins, etc.
- You prefer high-capacity vertical and horizontal scaling with familiar vCore-based cluster tiers such as M30, M40, M50 and more.
- You're running applications requiring 99.995% availability.
- You need native support for storing and searching vector embeddings.

### Choose RU-based if

- You're building new cloud-native MongoDB apps or refactoring existing apps for cloud-native benefits.
- Your workload has more point reads (fetching a single item by its _id and shard key value) and few long-running queries and complex aggregation pipeline operations.
- You want limitless horizontal scalability, instantaneous scale up, and granular throughput control.
- You're running mission-critical applications requiring industry-leading 99.999% availability.

## Resource and billing differences between the options

The vCore and RU services have different architectures with important billing differences.

[**Get started with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB RU**](./quickstart-python.md)

### vCore-based resources and billing

- You'd like dedicated instances that utilize preset CPU, memory, and storage resources, which can dynamically scale to suit your needs.
- You prefer to pay a consistent flat fee based on compute (CPU, memory, and the number of nodes) and storage.

### RU-based resources and billing

- You'd like a multitenant service that instantly allocates resources to your workload, aligning with storage and throughput requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Throughput is based on [Request Units (RUs)](../request-units.md).

- You prefer to pay fixed (standard provisioned throughput) or variable (autoscale) fees corresponding to Request Units (RUs) and consumed storage.

> [!NOTE]
> RU charges depend on the selected model: provisioned throughput (standard or autoscale) or serverless.
